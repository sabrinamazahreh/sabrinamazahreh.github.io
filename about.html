								<h1>About<br />
								</h1>
								<p>I moved to DC to work at a startup COVID laboratory following my graduation from The College of New Jersey in Spring of 2020. While that summer was difficult for the whole world, I was also navigating life after graduation during a pandemic in an unfamiliar city with my closest friends and family more than 190 miles away. On top of the difficulty adjusting to my new life, I began to realize the limits of my undergraduate degree in my professional life.</p>
                                <p>Working for a startup was challenging but nonetheless rewarding as everyone in the company worked to provide aid during the COVID19 crisis. My work in the lab didn’t go unnoticed as I was later selected from my department to work under the technical manager to work on developing a quality control plan and examine data from the analytical phase of COVID testing; this was my first exposure to data analytics.</p>
                                <p>Our work at the company proved to be successful as COVID numbers went down, as well as the need for testing. This ultimately led to a company wide layoff in September of 2021, the same month that my lease was ending. This was another challenging period but I took the opportunity to travel for almost 3 months; I lived in France, Belgium, and Italy while simultaneously earning a professional certificate in Data Analytics from Google. When my travels came to a close, I decided to come back to the now familiar city that I grew to love.</p>
                                <p>Outside of my professional life, I enjoy visiting museums, going on hikes, or taking a yoga class at my gym. My current read is Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari but my favorite book is Becoming Supernatural by Dr. Joe Dispenza. My future goals include becoming fluent in French, perfecting Clair de Lune on the piano, and eventually going back to school to earn my PhD.</p>
                                <p>While DC is now home, I grew up in New Jersey with my mother and two younger siblings. Being the eldest daughter of immigrants has been my greatest challenge to date but also the most rewarding feat that has shaped me into the innovative, resilient, and reliable person I am today. Life’s obstacles are neverending but I am confident in my capabilities to maneuver through anything and continue to build a life that I am proud of.</p>
